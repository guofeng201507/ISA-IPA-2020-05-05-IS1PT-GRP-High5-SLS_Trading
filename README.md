# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Stock market is an important part of the modern-day economy in terms of spending and investment. It creates a platform for businesses to raise additional capitals for expansion, for governments to roll out fiscal and monetary policies to promote greater investment, and for individuals to make personal wealth. However, opportunities are always coupled with risks (Little, 2020), there are many risks presented in stock trading (e.g. political environment and economic risks) and most of them are unpredictable (e.g. Black swan events). Although risks are unavoidable, with thoughtful selections that match oneâ€™s risk appetite, the risks can be significantly lowered. The aim of the project is to design and build an automated trading agent based on Reinforcement Learning methods to simulate the actions of a sophisticated investor in trading and to empower the agent with the ability to make fair decisions to maximize investment profits and to lower risks. The 4 reinforcement methods used in this project are: SARSA, Deep Q learning, Actor-Critic Network, PPO2. Our team has studied and assessed each method in stock trading carefully and scientifically to conclude their effectiveness in achieving the aim. On top of that, our team has also explored the limitations of these methods in meeting the goal and discussed some possible enhancements to overcome the obstacles.
